# Display ETH and BTC
This simple project pretty much fetches API data, uses the JSON, and displays the current ETH and BTC price. To avoid getting limited, I have set the refresh time of the page to 3 seconds.


Based on feedback will redo:
- fetch the data from the API
- store the data in state
- render the state from the render() function

Update: August 12, feedback done.
